# Example Concepts

## Why this section?

Any programming book needs examples. In my experience, I get more enjoyment out of the book if the examples are consistent and as a progression of the same domain's problems.

Towards that effort I want to flush out a few domains that are fun to explore. The example domains won't affect the code suggestions in this book, but they will affect it's theme and feel and also I think, it's ability to hold reader interest.

## Concept 1: A Simple Card Game - Blackjack



## Concept 2: A Youtube Statistics Client



## Concept 3: Decoupling Typical Rails Code

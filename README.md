# Writing Ruby Code That Doesn't Suck
### Principles, Patterns and Constraints

## Why a book?

I am a habitual career contractor. I like the excitement of new teams, new ideas, new pratices, new domains, and best of all - new problems. Yet every client who secures me to clean up one mess or another shares the same problem.

Their developers just vomit code out. I am sorry for such a distasteful adjective, but every time I look through a new codebase I see the same stuff:

* lack of testing
* lack of pattern and principle knowledge
* complex, long, untestable methods
* conditional logic overpowering the codebase
* no drawn boundaries or object model
* lots and lots of bugs and regressions

So I do what I do, and I start training my team in the ways of writing small, concise, testable code. Along the way I share what I have learned by much smarter men and women than myself.

Topics like design patterns and principles, boundaries and mocking and stubing, and general principles to keep their Ruby clean, extendable, testable, and best of all, bug free!

I want to tackle those concepts here in this book now, and share them with you in a format that I can bring to a larger audience. My hope is that you will learn something to aid you in writing better Ruby code - no matter what your skill level is!

To do so I will lean on the shoulders of some pretty amazing men and women. Many of them do not write Ruby as their main language, or might not write it at all. Our common language is problem solving and science, and old ideas become new again.
